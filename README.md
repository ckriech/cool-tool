# Cool Tool
## the world's first mono-directory java build tool

## FAQ

Q. What is this? Why would anyone make this?

A. Tbh the idea came out of a discussion with a friend during a discussion about packages in Java.
I realized the scope of what I don't know about what is convention vs required by java and common build tools, plus what exactly build tools are doing with dependencies and creating jars and etc.
So this is my attempt at figuring out what's going on.

I'm still carrying on the 'mono-directory' joke right now but I'm going to drop it if it gets in the way of the learning but it is fun to put a weird restriction on myself.
